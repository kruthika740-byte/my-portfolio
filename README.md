# 🛡️ ISE Engineering Portfolio | Kruthika R

An interactive, high-performance portfolio engineered for Information Science. This site serves as the front-end interface for a multi-service cloud architecture.

## 🚀 The "Why" (Design Philosophy)
Traditional portfolios are static. I built this to demonstrate a **live connection** between a modern UI and a remote backend. The goal was to show recruiters that I can handle:
* **API Integration:** Real-time data fetching from an external Flask server.
* **Modern UX:** Implementing Glassmorphism and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
* **Architecture:** Keeping the frontend decoupled from the logic for better scalability.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Framework:** Tailwind CSS
* **Animations:** AOS (Animate on Scroll)
* **Icons:** FontAwesome & Brand Logos
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

## 🔗 Live Integration
The site communicates with a Python/Flask API hosted on Render to power the **Stock Predictor**, **Secure Vault**, and **Lead Hunter** tools.
